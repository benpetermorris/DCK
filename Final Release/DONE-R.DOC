Quick notes:

 - DCK does NOT run under Windows 95 or Windows NT. To run DCK, you must
   exit to DOS (Win95 users can "restart the system in DOS mode.")

** If you have problems running DCK, please read TROUBLE.DOC before you
   contact me. Also, don't forget to use the new e-mail address regarding
   DCK questions, comments or problems:

                          dck-help@islandnet.com

 - The file HANDBK12.ZIP contains Bill McClendon's excellent level-
   building tutorial. Use any text editor to view the file, HANDBOOK.TXT,
   after you've extracted the ZIP.

   Thanks!
