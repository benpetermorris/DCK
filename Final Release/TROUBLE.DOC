 DCK - Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Contacting me for Technical Support
-------------------------------------

If you're having problems running DCK, please observe the following points 
before contacting me. I get a lot of email, and I don't have time to answer 
all of it!

--------
Terms
--------

CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT are files used by your computer when it's
starting up.  They can be found in the ROOT directory of your C:
drive, ie: "C:\CONFIG.SYS" and "C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT".

TSR - "Terminate and Stay Resident" (or "Device Driver".)  This is the
term given to those programs that are loaded when your system starts
up and stay active in memory.  Programs like Mouse Drivers and Memory
Managers are TSRs.


-----------------
What DCK Needs
-----------------

Make sure your system has the following resources available:

 - 25 "file handles."  This is the number in CONFIG.SYS under the
   "FILES=" setting - make sure the number after FILES= is at least 25.

 - HIMEM.SYS, or a device driver that provides similar capabilities.

 - About two megabytes of free memory.  If you don't have this much
   memory, follow the directions below.

---------------
Starting DCK
---------------

If you can't get DCK to run (that is, it doesn't load properly and you never 
see the map editing screen), your problem is probably listed here.

  ---

Symptom:
- DCK exits with the error message "Can't find driver" or "Can't find video 
  hardware."
- DCK starts up, but the screen is garbled or blank.

Problem:
DCK can't work with your video card directly; you'll have to run DCK in VESA 
mode. VESA mode is a little slower, but it works with almost any video card.

Solution: 
Load the VESA driver that came with your video card. The VESA driver is not a 
Windows driver, it is a .EXE or .COM file named something like "VESA.EXE".  
For example, ATI video cards include a file called "VVESA.COM". This program 
should be in the video card support directory on your hard drive.

Once you've located the VESA driver, run it by typing its name in at the DOS 
prompt. Then, change to your DCK directory and type "dck /v". The /v 
parameter tells DCK that you want to change your video driver - when the blue 
menu pops up, select "VESA driver" and press ENTER. Then, select the video 
mode and continue.

** Please note: You will have to load the VESA driver every time you start 
   your system if you want to use DCK. A good idea is to edit AUTOEXEC.BAT 
   and add the command to load the VESA driver at the end of the file.

Other Info:
If you can't find the VESA driver, you should contact the manufacturer of 
your video card and request that they send it to you. Alternatively, download 
this file from the Internet:

    ftp://ftp.islandnet.com/bmorris/univesa.zip

This file is SciTech's "universal VESA driver" that works with many video
cards. Please note that there is nothing I can do if you have no VESA driver
and your video card doesn't work with DCK.

  ---

Symptom:
- DCK doesn't work in Windows 95.

Solution:
Unfortunately, DCK will not run in Windows 95. You must "Restart the system 
in DOS mode" to run DCK.

  ---

Symptom:
- DCK exits with "memget: couldn't allocate nnn bytes", or a similar message.

Problem: 
DCK is running out of memory. You should have about 5 megabytes of free
memory before you run DCK.

Solution:
Run the MAKESWAP utility. Just type MAKESWAP a the DOS prompt, and then
run DCK again.

---------
EMM386
---------

EMM386 has been known to cause problems with DCK.  If your CONFIG.SYS
file loads EMM386.EXE, follow the instructions listed under "Other
Problems" a couple pages down.

Or, just remove the driver.


-------
QEMM
-------

When you install QEMM 7.0+, it places a device driver called QDPMI.SYS
in your CONFIG.SYS file.  This driver is incompatible with DCK -
luckily, it's not necessary to install it in most cases.  Simply
remove or comment the line in CONFIG.SYS that says:

DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QDPMI.SYS

To comment out the line, put the word "REM" in front of it.


--------------
Windows 3.1
--------------

Note: This is applicable only for Windows 3.1 - DCK WILL NOT RUN
under Windows NT or Windows 95.  id said it rightly: DOS extenders
suck.  Thanks, Microsoft!

To run DCK under Windows, you need to do the following:

1. Copy the file WINDPMI.386 into the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.
2. Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI:

   device=windpmi.386

If you have any problems, please let me know.

Note: I've included DCK.PIF - you should use this instead of DCK.BAT
or DCK32.EXE when you add DCK to the program manager.


-----------------
Other Problems
-----------------

If you can't find a solution above, read this section.

Many TSRs and other programs loaded at startup can cause problems with
DCK because of its use of system resources.  Unfortunately, this is
not something I can do much about - the standards developed by the
"big software companies" to allow programs like DCK and the TSRs to
coexist on a system are not entirely robust and can present many minor
problems depending on your system's setup.

Therefore, if you're having a problem that you can't find a workaround
for, I suggest the following course of action:

1. Rename autoexec.bat and config.sys to some other names, like
   "autoexec.dck" and "config.dck".
2. Create a new config.sys with the following statements in it:

     FILES=25
     DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS

3. Reboot your machine.
4. Try out DCK again.

If you still have problems, please contact me using the email address
at the top of the file.

If DCK works properly, the culprit is one of the programs loaded at
startup; the only way to figure out exactly WHICH program is to add
lines back into config.sys and autoexec.bat, one by one, and rebooting
your machine and testing DCK after you've made each change.  This
method is a last resort, but in most cases the problem will be found
and you'll be able to use DCK with a slightly modified configuration.
I wish there were an easier way!
