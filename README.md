# DCK
The DOOM Construction Kit

This code is exactly as it was on the project's last release on June 15, 1996. 

Almost, anyway: the original repository has some binaries from the compiler and graphics libraries I originally used, so I haven't included those here for copyright reasons. (I'm not sure if anyone still cares about the copyright to the Borland C++ compiler or their PowerPack DOS extender system, but you never know.)

In case anyone does ever visit this repository, please keep in mind that I wrote this code between the ages of 17 and 19, just a few years after I first taught myself C; most of it is pretty rough.
