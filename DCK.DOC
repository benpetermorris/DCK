             Introducing DCK


             This user's guide will help you learn to use DCK, but it does
             not include specific instructions for creating some of the
             special effects found in other maps. The distribution disk that
             you received DCK on contains invaluable reference material that
             you should browse if you're stuck for ideas.

             Chapter 2

             Starting Up


             When you first start the editor, you'll be asked for the type of
             video card you have installed. If you don't recognize the name
             of your video card on the list, select "VESA Driver" or "Auto-
             Detect."

             Now, select the video mode you want DCK to use - DCK supports
             resolutions from 640x480 to 1280x1024, depending on your video
             card and monitor. If you find that the resolution you select
             makes the text in DCK appear too small, select a lower
             resolution. On the other hand, if you find that you don't have
             much screen space for editing your map, select a higher
             resolution.

             You can reconfigure the video card and video mode that DCK uses
             at any time by typing "DCK /v" at the DOS prompt.

             Configuring DCK
             You can skip this section if you want to move on quickly _ just
             press ESC when the Configuration dialog box shows up.

             The first time you run DCK, the configuration dialog box is
             displayed. You don't need to change any of the settings here _
             the preset values will work just fine, and you can come back and
             customize the options here at any time by selecting
             "Configuration" from the File Menu, or by pressing Alt+N.

             General Options

             AutoZoom Scales: These are the zoom values that the editor jumps
               between when the Z key is pressed.

             Backups: Sets how often the editor does a backup:
               -  Never means that a backup is never made.
               -  Every Save means that the last version is backed up every
                  time the file is saved.
               -  First Save means that the last version is backed up the
                  first time a file is saved after being loaded.


             Options

             Hold down SHIFT for additive selection: Check this if you want
               the editor to unmark the already marked objects before
               marking another, unless SHIFT is held down. This is a
               familiar method for Mac users.

             Always combine exact vertices: This setting means that the
               editor will always combine vertices that occupy the same


      4   DCK 3.0 User's Guide


               position, instead of asking you. The editor always asks
               before joining vertices that are "close."

             Translate marks between edit modes: Means that the editor will
               mark the Lines of a marked Sector when you switch from the
               Sector Tool to the Line Tool.

             Automatically unpeg unmoving upper/lower textures: This setting
               tells the editor to automatically set the "upper unpegged"
               and "lower unpegged" flags of a new Line, if it has Upper /
               Lower areas. Setting these flags makes archways and windows
               look better. "Unmoving" means that the flags will be set only
               if the Line in question doesn't belong to a Sector with a
               Sector Tag.

             Map scrolls when cursor reaches screen edge: If this is set, the
               editor will automatically scroll the map in the direction of
               the edge that the cursor's on, but only if it's on the edge!

             Ask for game-run parameters: When you test your map from within
               the editor, it will ask you for the parameters with which to
               run the map - skill level, the "no monsters" setting, and so
               on. Turn this off if you'd rather skip this step and run the
               map with the game's defaults.

             Display Dialog-box PopHelp: New users should leave this on! The
               editor will display a short description box for the Dialog
               Box field you're currently in, if there's a description
               available. You can toggle this setting at any time by
               pressing Shift+F1.

             Display Tips when DCK starts up: This useful feature displays a
               quick tip on using DCK whenever you start the editor.

             Defaults
             These settings can be toggled without coming back to the
             configuration dialog, because you might want to switch them on
             or off many times during an editing session. The defaults you
             select here are used when you load a new map, and when you first
             start the editor.

             Display Grid: Displays the grid (see Using the Grid, page 9) by
               default.

             AutoJoin Mode: Sets Auto-Join mode (see The Auto-Join Feature,
               page 14) on by default.

             Snap Objects ...: Sets the default "snap" mode (see Using Snap
               to Grid, page 9.)

             Graphical Item Display
             Normally, the editor displays the Items (Monsters, Health
             Potions, and so on) on the map as colour-coded squares.
             Graphical Item Display is a special feature of the editor that


                                                                            5


             uses the pictures of the Items from the game to display them on
             the map. This makes it much easier to discern what's in an area
             of the map simply by looking at it. The disadvantage to this
             feature is that it slows down the map display on older systems.

             Never means that the graphical item display will never be used.

             Primary means that graphical item display is the default Item
               display mode, and that colour-coded squares are Secondary.

             Secondary means that colour-coded squares is the default Item
               display mode.

             Small Icons At: When you're "zoomed out" very far, displaying
               graphical items looks messy - the items overlap and are
               difficult to work with. So, the editor automatically turns
               off graphical items if the "zoom" setting is above this
               number.

             Large Icons At: When you're zoomed in, it's better to work with
               bigger pictures of each item - the editor automatically
               enlarges the pictures when the zoom setting is below this
               number.

             You can toggle graphical item display by switching to "Item
             Mode" again.






             Chapter 3

             Using the Interface


             DCK's interface is modeled after Microsoft's Windows 95
             operating system. Most of the dialog box controls function in
             the same way as Windows' controls, so you should have no problem
             navigating DCK if you've used Windows.

             Following is a short description of each of DCK's interface
             elements, and how to use them.

             Using the Menu System
             To make a selection from the menu system, move the mouse cursor
             to one of the titles on the menu bar and click the left mouse
             button once. If you've clicked on an item with a submenu, that
             menu will be displayed - you can now move the cursor around and
             the menu system will follow your movements.

             When you've made a choice, click the left mouse button once on
             the item you'd like to activate. If you decide to cancel your
             selection, click the right mouse button once.

             You can also activate the menu system with the keyboard - press
             ESC to access the menu bar, and use the arrow keys to flip
             through each menu and the items in it. When you've made a
             choice, press Enter to select the highlighted item. If you
             decide to cancel your selection, press ESC to close the menu
             system.

                 Tip: You can quickly make a selection from a menu by
                 pressing the red highlighted key of the item you've
                 chosen.


             Using dialog boxes
             At various points in the editor, a dialog box will be displayed.
             Dialog boxes are a convenient way of gathering a lot of
             information - here's how to navigate them:

             Press This...        To do This.
             TAB / Shift+TAB      Move to the Next / Previous Field
             Enter or F10         "Save" the Dialog Box and proceed
             Esc or F9 or Right   "Cancel" the Dialog Box and the current
             Mouse Button         operation

             Other keys do different things based on what kind of Field
             you're currently in. Below is a list of the types of fields, and
             how to navigate each with the mouse and the keyboard.


                                                                            7


             String Fields
             String fields are for entering text information - the name of an
             Editing Program, for example, or number information - the
             altitude of a floor, for example.

             When you type in a String Field, the characters are added at the
             Insertion Point - the blinking vertical bar in the field. If
             Insert Mode is on, the rest of the string is shifted to the
             right to make room for the new character. Otherwise, the
             character to the right of the insertion point is replaced with
             the key you've just pressed.

             Below is a list of commands you can use to manipulate the
             contents of the string field:

             Press This...        To do This.
             Left / Right         Move the insertion point to the
                                  previous/next character in the field.
             Home                 Move the insertion point to the first
                                  character in the field
             End                  Move the insertion point to the last
                                  character in the field
             Backspace            Delete the character to the left of the
                                  insertion point
             Delete               Delete the character to the right of the
                                  insertion point
             Insert               Toggle Insert / Overstrike mode


             Checkbox Fields
             A checkbox field is an "On / Off" setting. Toggle the checkbox
             with the spacebar, or click the left button once on the Checkbox
             (or its associated text) to change the setting.

             Sometimes, a checkbox will have a "greyed" setting. This setting
             means that the checkbox's state is neutral - when the Dialog Box
             is saved, this checkbox won't be taken into account.

             Radio Buttons
             A Radio Button Group is a series of choices that are "mutually
             exclusive" - when one is set, none of the others can be. In the
             example to the right, the group is a choice of backup methods;
             certainly, you couldn't have "never back up" and "back up every
             save" selected at the same time!

             Select a choice from a radio button group by clicking on one of
             the circles, or its associated text. If you're using the
             keyboard, the four arrow keys move the selection around - press
             TAB or Shift+TAB to move to the next field.

             Listbox Fields
             A Listbox Field presents a scrollable list of choices, from
             which one selection can be made. The highlighted selection
             appears with a dark background.


      8   DCK 3.0 User's Guide



             Press This...  To do This.
             Up / Down      Scroll the list Up and Down
             Page Up /      Scroll the list one page Up and Down
             Page Down
             Home           Move to the first choice in the list
             End            Move to the last choice in the list

             You can also use the mouse to scroll the listbox. Click and hold
             down the left button inside the box, and drag the cursor to a
             position above (to scroll up) or below (to scroll down) the
             listbox. Release the left button anytime to stop scrolling.

             An easy way to search for an item in the listbox is to simply
             type what you're looking for. If what you've typed in matches
             any of the text at the beginning of an item, that item will be
             highlighted. If the next character you enter can't be found, the
             highlight bar won't move. You can hit backspace at any time to
             go to the previously-found item. Use the arrow keys or the mouse
             at any time to move the highlight bar.

             Buttons
             Buttons are very simple fields - when you click on one or press
             the spacebar in one, the action that's titled on the button is
             performed.

             Most dialog boxes have at least two buttons, labelled "Ok" and
             "Cancel." OK saves the contents of the dialog box, and Cancel
             cancels the actions you were taking that brought up the dialog
             box.

             Making a Selection from a Choice List
             A "Choice List" Dialog Box, like the one below, is used in
             various parts of the editor to allow you to make a selection
             from a list of available items.

             The String and Listbox Fields in this dialog box work in tandem:
             When you type words in the "Search" field, a list of all the
             items that contain those words is displayed in the "Found items"
             field, below it.

             You don't have to type whole words - just an abbreviation
             usually finds what you're looking for. If you see what you're
             looking for in the list, you can use the Up and Down arrow keys
             to select the item, and press Enter when you've made your
             choice. You can cancel the selection anytime by pressing Escape.

                 Tip: You don't have to leave the Search field to scroll
                 through the Found Items field; the arrow keys will move
                 the selection bar from either one.

             Navigating the Map


             While you're working on a map, you're always viewing it from a
             "top-down" perspective. DCK allows you move the map and to
             "zoom" on a part of the map, showing its layout in detail.

             Use the following keys to change the map display:

             Press This ..  To do This.
             Up, Down,      Move the map
             Left, Right
             Ctrl+G         Center the map
             1-9, 0         Use preset zoom levels
             + / -          Zoom in / out
             Z              Quickly zoom in / out on the cursor

             You can also use the mouse to scroll the map. First, make sure
             that the "Map Scrolls at Screen Edge" option in the
             Configuration dialog box (Alt+N) is checked. Now, scroll the map
             by moving the mouse cursor to any of the four edges of the
             screen.

             Using the Grid
             The editor has a "grid" feature that gives you an easy way to
             line things up properly. You can use the grid to visually line
             things up, and you can also tell the editor to "snap" objects to
             the grid. The grid is fully adjustable, so you can keep the
             "snap to grid" feature on and still retain a good level of
             detail simply by turning down the grid spacing.

             The default Grid Spacing is 64 - this means that each grid Point
             on the map is 64 map units from the one next to it. The square
             bracket keys adjust the grid spacing: `[` halves the current
             grid spacing, and `]' doubles the spacing.

             Using Snap to Grid
             There are three Snap to Grid modes: Off, On, and Snap to Vertex.
             Off means that the editor will never "snap" objects to the grid,
             and On means that Jupiter is Purple. "Snap to Vertex" means that
             objects will "snap" to the closest grid point, or the closest
             Vertex - whichever is closest! This is useful for joining a
             vertex to another that was created on a lower grid spacing.
             Press `P' to toggle the Snap to Grid mode, or select it from the
             Edit menu.

             Marking Objects
             "Marking" provides an easy way to change many objects all at
             once. A Marked object is highlighted in red on the map. There
             are a few ways to mark objects:


      10  DCK 3.0 User's Guide


             - Move the mouse cursor over the object you want to mark, and
               click the left mouse button once. The object won't be drawn
               in red until you move the cursor off the object.
             - Move the mouse cursor away from any object, and hold down the
               left mouse button and "drag out" the box. When you release
               the button, every object contained in the box is marked.

             Unmarking objects is just as easy:

             - Move the mouse cursor over a marked object, and click the
               left mouse button once. When you move the mouse away from the
               object, it will no longer be drawn in red.
             - Hold down the right mouse button, wait for the Cursor Pad to
               disappear, and then "drag out" the box. When you release the
               button, every object contained in the box is unmarked.
             - Press `C' to unmark all objects, or select "Clear Marks" from
               the Edit Menu.

             The rest of this user's guide notes when "marked" objects come
             into effect.






             Chapter 5

             Drawing Your Map


             This chapter describes how to draw new areas on your map with
             DCK's drawing tools - the Line-drawing tool, the Rectangle tool
             and the Polygon tool. A later chapter, "Modifying the
             Architecture of Your Map", details changing areas that have
             already been drawn.

             Drawing Odd-Shaped Areas
             Using the Line-Drawing tool, you can create an area of any shape
             and size. To use the tool, press 'L', or select "Line Tool" from
             the Edit menu.

             Creating a New Area with the Line Tool
             This section covers creating a new, "unconnected" area on your
             map.

             To start drawing the area, double-click the left mouse button
             (Step 1.) Next, drag the mouse to where you'd like the first
             line to finish, and click the left mouse button once (Step 2.)

             Repeat Step 2 until you've got a figure like the one shown to
             the left. Now, click the right mouse button once. The figure
             will automatically be closed, and you've got a new area!

             You can perform the same steps here inside an existing area to
             create a "sector within a sector."

             Creating a Connected Area with the Line Tool
             This section covers creating a connected area with the Line
             Tool. A connected area means that part of the new area you draw
             is connected to existing parts of the map. This is an easy way
             to add new rooms and corridors to the parts of your map that are
             already drawn. In this example, we'll be extending the new area
             that was created in the previous section.

             Move the cursor over a part of the top, right line (Point `A' in
             the figure to the right) and double-click the left mouse button
             (Step 1.) Now, move the cursor to the `X' in the figure and
             click once (Step 2.)


      12 DCK 3.0 User's Guide



             Repeat Step 2 until you've got a figure like the one shown to
             the left. Then, click the right mouse button once on Point `B'
             to complete the area (Step 3.)

             After you complete Step 3, the area you've just created will be
             connected to the existing area with a two-sided Line - a new
             Line that is automatically created between points A and B.

                 Note: Points A and B must reside on the same existing
                 line, and no other part of the new area must  touch
                 existing areas while it's being drawn. These are
                 limitations of the editor.


             Drawing Rectangles
             To use the rectangle tool, press 'R' or select "Rectangle Tool"
             from the Edit menu.

             To draw a rectangle, hold the left mouse button down and drag
             the rectangle to the size you want.  Release the left mouse
             button when you're done.

             Using the rectangle tool with auto-join mode On is the quickest
             way to create new areas in your map.  When you finish drawing
             the rectangle, DCK will automatically connect its sides to
             existing rooms.  For example, you can create a hallway between
             two square rooms very easily simply by "dragging out" a
             rectangle between them.  Remember, you must have Auto-Join mode
             On for this to work.

             There are a couple of other things to remember about the
             rectangle tool (and any tool in DCK): If you have snap to grid
             mode on, the four points (vertices) of the rectangle will snap
             to the current grid size.  You can toggle any of the editor's
             settings while you're drawing the rectangle - if you decide you
             need a smaller grid, you needn't start all over: just press the
             [ key a few times.

             Finally, if you decide not to add the rectangle, you can hit ESC
             while continuing to hold down the left button, and DCK will stop
             drawing it.

                 Tip: While you're creating the rectangle, you can move
                 it to an entirely new position by holding down the
                 right mouse button as well as the left button to drag
                 the rectangle to a new location.  When you release the
                 right button, you can still change the size of the
                 rectangle by moving the mouse. This feature also
                 applies to Polygons.


                                                                           13


             Drawing Polygons
             To use the polygon tool, press 'N' or select "Polygon Tool" from
             the Edit menu.

             To draw a polygon, hold the left mouse button down and drag the
             polygon to the size you want.  Release the left mouse button
             when you're done.  If you have Auto-Join mode on, DCK will
             automatically connect the polygon's sides to existing lines - if
             they overlap, of course.


      14 DCK 3.0 User's Guide


             The following keys control how the polygon is drawn:

             Press     To do This.
             This ..
             Q and W   Decrease / Increase the number of sides in the
                       polygon
             A and E   Rotate the Polygon
             Ctrl      Hold down Ctrl to constrain the polygon to a circle

             Just like the Rectangle Tool, if you have snap to grid mode on,
             the vertices of the polygon will snap to the current grid size.
             You can toggle any of the editor's settings while you're drawing
             the polygon - if you decide you need a smaller grid, you needn't
             start all over: just press the [ key a few times.

             Finally, if you decide you don't want to add a polygon, you can
             hit ESC while continuing to hold down the left button, and DCK
             will stop drawing it.

             The Auto-Join Feature
             When Auto-Join mode is on, DCK automatically joins "close" parts
             of the map when the map is modified. This is useful for
             connecting areas by dragging them together (see Joining Separate
             Areas, page 28.)

             If Auto-Join mode is so useful, why would you want to turn it
             off? When you're working in crowded areas of your map, sometimes
             DCK will join parts of the map that you didn't want joined. You
             can toggle Auto-Join mode with the `J' key, or select it from
             the Miscellaneous menu.

                 Tip: If DCK joins something you didn't intend to be
                 joined, you can always "undo" the last action by
                 pressing Alt+Backspace. Then, turn off Auto-Join mode
                 and try again.


                                                                           15



             Chapter 6

             Adding Monsters and
             Other Items


             Items are the non-architectural parts of a map, such as:

             - Monsters that attack the player;
             - Decorations such as lamps, pedestals and rotting corpses;
             - Weapons like the shotgun and a magic wand;
             - Useful Items, including health potions, ammunition and armor.

             Other kinds of Items are used as "placeholders" by the game, and
             by scripts in the game Hexen. For example, the Player 1 Start
             Item shown below tells the game to place the first player at the
             location of that Item. Other placeholders include:

             - Teleporters work by moving the player to a specific "Teleport
               Exit" Item;
             - MapSpots (in Hexen) are used as placeholders by Scripts and
               Special Actions;
             - Environmental sounds (in Heretic and Hexen) are played near
               Sound Items.

             Creating and Editing Items
             Press 'I' or choose "Item Tool" from the Edit Menu to access the
             Item Tool.

             - To create a new Item, double-click the left mouse button.
             - To edit an existing Item or Items, mark the Items and click
               the right mouse button once.

             The Item Properties dialog box is displayed.

             Item Attributes

             Item Type: There are two ways to enter this information _ the
               easiest is by pressing F2 or double-clicking on the field and
               selecting an Item from the list of choices displayed (see
               Making a Selection from a Choice List, page 8.)  The second
               way is to simply type in the entire name of the Item.


                 Tip: You can type a partial name in the Item Type field
                 _ for example, "gun" _ and press Enter to see a list of
                 Items that contain what you've typed.


             Altitude (Hexen Only): Enter the Altitude of the Item when the
               level is first loaded. This number is relative to the height
               of the floor of the sector that the Item is in. This value is
               not necessary - it can be left at 0 without any problems.


      16 DCK 3.0 User's Guide


             Angle: Enter the Angular direction that the Item faces when the
               level is first loaded, or press F2 to make a selection from a
               list of choices.

                 Tip: To quickly change the direction that one item
                 faces, move the cursor over the item and press
                 Ctrl+Left or Ctrl+Right.


             PolyID (Hexen Only): Enter the ID of the Poly Object that the
               Item is associated with. For more information on Poly
               Objects, see the Official Hexen Specifications.

             Only one of the Angle and PolyID fields will be available for
               each item - if one is shown, the other is not needed.

             TID (Hexen Only): Enter the "Thing ID" of the Item. This number
               is used to associate the Item with other actions in the game
               - for example, you could set up an action to destroy all
               Monster Items with a certain "Thing ID."

             "Special" Fields (Hexen Only)
             The "Special" fields in the Item Properties are what makes
             things happen when the Item is destroyed - in the case of a
             Monster, or another "Destroyable" Item. These fields are used in
             the same manner as the Special Fields in the Line Properties
             dialog box (see "Special" Fields, page 23.)

             Certain Item Types require one or more Special Arguments to
             operate correctly. In this case, the Special Type field will be
             unavailable, and the required Argument fields will be captioned.
             In the example above, the Player 1 Start Item can be given a
             "Start Spot" number. See the Official Hexen Specifications for
             details on the Arguments that certain Items require.

             Item Flags (Checkboxes)
             The following is a table of the checkboxes in the Item Edit
             dialog box, and their meanings:

             Hexen games only.)             Multi-Player mode.

             The Fighter, Cleric and Mage settings only apply for Single-
             Player mode. Multi-Player Items appear regardless of the classes
             playing.


             Monster Item Flags
             The following flags affect monster items only, even though
             they're available for all items.

                      Thing_Activate( )
                      Special.

             Changing which Items are Displayed
             To change which Items are displayed on the map, select "Display
             Filter" from the Object Menu or press 'D'. The Item Filter
             dialog box is displayed.

             Each item is a 3-state checkbox, all of which are grayed by
             default. Here's how it works:

             - If a selection is ON (the checkbox is 'X'ed), the editor
               will only display those Items whose corresponding flag is
               ON. For example, if you 'X' the Ambush flag, the editor
               will only display an Item if its Ambush flag is also set
               ON.
             - If a selection is OFF (the checkbox is cleared), the
               editor displays an Item only if the item's identical flag
               is set OFF.
             - If a box is set to "don't care" (the checkbox is greyed),
               the editor displays each Item regardless of the setting
               of its corresponding flag.

             To turn off the filter, press 'D' once more.

             Moving Existing Items
             To change the placement of an existing item or series of items
             on your map, first mark the items you want to move. Next, move
             the mouse cursor over one of the marked items and hold down the
             left mouse button. When you move the mouse, all the marked items
             will move with it - simply drag them into the desired placement
             and release the left mouse button.

                 Tip: You can copy the marked items to a new position
                 (instead of simply moving them) by double-clicking the
                 left mouse button and dragging before completing the
                 second click. So; press down, up, down, and then drag.

             Changing the Architecture
             of Your Map


             DCK features a powerful set of tools for changing the appearance
             and architecture of your map.

             Using Motifs
             A "Motif" is a set of textures and other information that is
             used to "colour" an area on your map. For example, you could
             create a Motif with a medeival theme - stone walls, rock floors
             and a low light level - and apply that theme to any area on your
             map with a simple command. The textures in the selected Motif
             are also used in new areas that you create.

                 Note: The selected Motif is shown on the Status Bar at
                 the bottom of the screen.


             Selecting, Editing and Creating Motifs
             To select a Motif, press Alt+M or select "Motifs..." from the
             Edit Menu. The Motif dialog box is displayed.

             Available Motifs: This is the list of Motifs that are already
               available for use. Use the mouse or the cursor keys to select
               a Motif, and press Enter to close the dialog box and save
               your choice.

             Use the Edit button to change the contents of the highlighted
             Motif. The New button allows you to create a new Motif, and the
             Delete button deletes the highlighted Motif.

             When you create or edit a Motif, a dialog box with the following
             fields appears:

             Motif Name: This is the name of the Motif you're editing, for
               example "Red Bricks and Lava."

             Motif Fields: The list of Fields each Motif contains. The dialog
               field to the right of this list changes to reflect the value
               for the highlighted Motif Field.

             You can change any of the values in the Motif simply by moving
             to the value field and typing something different. If the value
             displayed is a wall or floor/ceiling texture, use the F2 key or
             double-click on the field to use the Texture Browser (see page
             22.)

             Applying Motifs
             You can apply a Motif to Walls or Sectors. When you apply a
             Motif to a wall or a series of walls, each of the wall's non-


      20  DCK 3.0 User's Guide


             blank textures is replaced with the corresponding wall texture
             in the Motif. Applying a Motif to a sector or a series of
             sectors is more complete:

             - the Motif is applied to each wall in the sector,
             - the sector's floor and ceiling textures are changed to those
               set in the Motif, and
             - the sector's light level is set to the light level in the
               Motif.

             To apply the selected Motif, mark the walls or sectors you want
             to affect and press Ctrl+E or choose "Apply Motif" from the Edit
             Menu.

             Copying the Appearance of one Object to Others
             Most often used with sectors, the format painter is useful for
             ensuring consistency in appearance where it's needed. It works
             like this: Mark the objects you want to change, activate the
             format painter, and select the object you want to copy from. To
             activate the format painter, choose it from the Miscellaneous
             Menu or press Ctrl+P.

             After you select the object to copy from, DCK displays a menu of
             combinations to copy. Select one of the combinations or press
             ESC to abort the format painter operation.

             Working with Sectors
             A Sector is an area in your map that can be drawn by tracing a
             closed path of lines starting and ending at the same point
             (Vertex.) The following picture shows some sectors:

             Editing Sector Properties
             To edit a sector's properties, select the sector(s) you want to
             edit and click the right mouse button once. The Sector
             Properties dialog box appears:

             Special Feature: A sector's special feature is used to create
               effects such as blinking lights, scrolling floors and the
               appearance of wind. Select the special feature you want to
               use from this list.

                 Note: The sector features available depends on the game
                 you're creating a map for - for example, windy sectors
                 and scrolling floors are only available in Heretic and
                 Hexen.


             Floor/Ceiling Textures: Change the appearance of the floor and
               ceiling by selecting a texture from these lists, or press F2
               to make a selection with the texture browser.

             Floor/Ceiling Heights: Enter the altitude of the floor and
               ceiling here. Negative numbers are allowed.


                                                                           21


             Light Level: Enter the light level of the sector(s). The valid
               range for the light level is between 0 and 255.

             Sector Tag: Enter the "tag" of the sector(s).

             Offsetting the Height of Many Floors and Ceilings
             This feature allows you to change the height of floors and
             ceilings by a set value. For example, you may want to raise an
             entire area on your map by 200 units after adding a staircase
             for the player to enter the area. To edit each sector and add
             200 to its floor and ceiling heights would be a tedious task,
             especially if you've added the staircase after making a complex
             area.

             To overcome this problem, simply mark all the sectors you want
             to raise or lower, and press Ctrl+H. A dialog box with the
             following fields appears:

             Change floor height(s) by: Enter the value to add to each floor
               height. Enter a negative number to lower the floor heights.

             Change ceiling height(s) by: Enter the value to add to each
               ceiling height.

             Amplify light by: You can modify the light level of the sectors
               by entering an amplification value here. This sets each
               sector's light level to a percentage (the value you enter) of
               its current light level.

             Creating Doors and Lifts
             Using the door and lift tools, you can easily create the two
             most common kinds of moving things in a map.

             Both of the tools use Sectors, so you must be in Sector Mode.

             Mark the Sector, and press Ctrl+D to create a door or Ctrl+L to
             create a lift. Depending on which game you're editing, a list of
             choices or a dialog box is displayed with options for the door
             or lift you want to create. Select one of the items in the list
             or fill out the dialog box and press Enter to create the door or
             lift.

             Working with Walls (Lines)
             The games DCK is designed to work with use 2-dimensional maps -
             each Line on the map represents a wall in the game. The maps you
             create are a little like traditional pencil mazes: there's only
             one plane the pencil, or player, can move in. No area can be
             above or below another.

             Changing the Appearance of Walls
             Lines, or Walls, are covered with Wall Textures. Each game
             contains a set of textures that you can use on the walls in your
             map. The editor also supports textures that are created with


      22  DCK 3.0 User's Guide


             other programs, like Olivier Montanuy's excellent utility,
             WinTex.

             You can change the textures that are used on a Wall using the
             Line Tool. Press `L' or select "Line Tool" from the Edit Menu to
             select the tool.

             - To edit a single Line, first make sure no objects are marked.
               Then, move the cursor over the Line you want to edit and
               click the right mouse button once.
             - If you want to edit more than one Line at a time, mark the
               Lines you want to change and click the right mouse button
               once.

             The Line Properties dialog box is displayed.


                 Tip: For information on the three texture slots and
                 when each is displayed in the game, read or print out
                 the tutorial file TEXTURES.DOC that was installed to
                 the same directory as the editor.

             To change one of the three textures, move into the field below
             its picture and press F2, or double-click on the field. The
             Texture Browser dialog box is displayed, from which you can
             select a new texture to use.

             Use the mouse or the following keys to make a selection from the
             Texture Browser:

             Press This...    To do This.
             Up / Down /      Move the selection rectangle

                              names
             Enter            Select the texture in the rectangle
             Alt+F            Search for a texture
             / and \          Search again forwards and backwards
             Esc              Close the Browser and keep the current

             "Special" Fields
             The Special Fields are used to activate special effects in the
             map. When a player or monster "activates" the line, its Special
             Fields are used by the game to create an effect such as:

             - a door or doors opening;
             - teleporting the character that activated the line to another
               position;
             - creating an earthquake;
             - turning off the lights in a room;
             - and so on.

             A line can be activated by a player or monster walking over the
             line, or by a player "using" the line.
             The effects that are available depend on the game you're editing
             for:

             The games Doom, Doom 2 and Heretic have over a hundred special
             effects, but many of them are the same effect activated
             differently, since these games don't allow you to choose the
             effect and how it's activated independently of each other. For
             example, there are four listed effects that open a remote door;
             the only difference is how they're activated and whether they
             can be activated more than once.

             Each special effect for these games has a two-character
             "activation code" before the special effect. The first character
             is How the line is activated: W means Walk, as in when the line
             is crossed; S means Spacebar, as in when the line is "used" by
             the player; and G means Gun, as in when a bullet hits or crosses
             the line. The second character is either "R" or "1", meaning
             that the line can be activated Repeatedly or only once,
             respectively.


      24  DCK 3.0 User's Guide



             The game Hexen affords you the most flexibility when choosing a
             special effect, because it allows you to set how the line is
             activated independently of the special effect you choose. The
             "Activation" radio buttons and the "Repeatable" checkbox allow
             you to set how the line is activated, and whether it can be
             activated once, or more than once.

             "Flipping" Walls
             There are two ways to flip a wall " by flipping its direction,
             or by flipping only its sides. Flipping the direction of a wall
             means simply that its physical First and Second sides are
             reversed. Flipping a wall's sides means that the information
             contained in each side of the wall is swapped _ this only works
             on walls with two sides, of course.

             - To flip the direction of a wall or a series of walls, mark
               the walls you want to flip and press Ctrl+F.
             - To flip a wall's sides, or the sides on a series of walls,
               mark the walls you want to change and press Ctrl+R.

             You might want to flip a wall because some Special Actions only
             occur if the player walks across the line from the first side.
             For example, the Teleporter Special only works if the player
             crosses the line from the first side to the second.

             Aligning the Textures on a Series of Walls
             The texture on each wall is drawn independently of the textures
             on the adjacent wall. This means that two walls side by side
             that contain the same text

             Creating Stairs with the Stair Tool
             To create stairs, you must mark two lines, which will become the
             sides of the stairs.

             After selecting two lines (from Line mode), press Ctrl+Z or
             choose "Create Stairs..." from the Object menu. DCK will display
             a dialog box for you to enter information about the stairs you'd
             like to create.

                 Note: The dialog box contains a simple "preview" of the
                 direction of the steps; the green circle indicates the
                 first step, and the red circle indicates the last.

             The fields in the dialog box are:

             Number of stairs: Enter the number of stairs you want to create.

             Step height: Enter the height of each step. If you want to
               create a descending staircase, enter a negative value, such
               as -8. Remember that the maximum height the player can step
               over (without jumping in Hexen) is 24.


                                                                           25


             First stair floor: Enter the height of the first step. DCK
               automatically sets this when you press Ctrl+Z, and you can
               change it to another value if you wish. If you change the
               "last stair floor" field, this field is automatically updated
               based on the number of steps and the step height.

             First stair ceiling: Enter the height of the first step's
               ceiling.

             Last stair floor: Enter the height of the last step's floor.

             Last stair ceiling: Enter the height of the last step's ceiling.
               If the "Stair Ceiling" checkbox is cleared, this field is
               ignored and all stairs have the height of the first stair's
               ceiling.

             Options for the stair tool are in checkboxes:

             Reverse direction: Check this box to flip the direction of the
               steps.

             Stair ceiling: Check this to stair the ceiling as well as the
               floor. If unchecked, the stairs will all have the same
               ceiling height as the first stair.

             Hidden: Check this box to make the staircase "hidden", so that
               it can be made to rise from the floor. In this case, DCK sets
               all the stair floor heights to the same as the first step's
               floor.

             After you've entered all the options, press F10 or click on OK
             to create the stairs. DCK will create the stairs along the
             length of the lines you marked.

             Notes:
             - Make sure that the marked lines form part of a whole sector.
               DCK creates the step sectors in between and along the lengths
               of the lines, which become the sides of the staircase.
             - The lines should have nothing in between them when you create
               the stairs. This does not include Game Items, but other lines
               will make DCK create an improper staircase.
             - If the staircase isn't exactly what you wanted, press
               Alt+Backspace to delete what you've done and try again.


             Changing the Architecture of Your Map
             This section covers modifying existing parts of your map.

             Creating a Single Line
             Creating a single line is useful for making an invisible
             "trigger" line that the player crosses to activate. To create
             one line, use the Line-drawing tool and double-click anywhere
             inside an area. Move the cursor to the new line's end-point, and
             click the right mouse button once.


      26  DCK 3.0 User's Guide



             DCK displays a menu with two choices; select "Create 2-sided
             line." The line becomes two-sided, with both sides referencing
             the sector you created it in. Don't be alarmed by the
             "unconnected" appearance of the line when you highlight its
             sector in sector mode; as long as both sides of the line
             reference the sector, it will appear correctly _ that is, it
             won't appear at all _ in the game.

             Separating One Line into Two
             There are two ways to "split" a line. First, you can tell DCK to
             split the line at its centerpoint _ then, the line becomes two
             lines separated by a vertex at the center of the original line.
             Second, you can add a vertex at any point along the line using
             the mouse.

             To split at the centerpoint, highlight or mark the lines you
             want to split and press Ctrl+C, or choose "Split Lines" from the
             Object Menu.

             To split a line anywhere along its length, move the mouse cursor
             to a point on the line (make sure it's "highlighted" in yellow.)
             Hold down the Ctrl key, and click the left mouse button once.

             Joining Two Lines into One
             To join two lines into one, they must both face the same
             direction. If you find that the two lines you want to join are
             not facing in the same direction, flip one of the lines (see
             "Flipping" Walls, page 24.)

             To join the two lines by deleting the vertex that separates
             them, highlight the vertex and press Del. The vertex will be
             deleted and the lines joined into one.

             Creating a Pillar by deleting a Sector
             A sector that is an "island" in another sector can be deleted to
             form a pillar from floor to ceiling. To create a pillar:

             1.                Switch to Sector Mode,
             2.                Highlight (move the mouse over) the sector you want to create
               a pillar from,
             3.                Press Del to delete the sector.

             In fact, the easiest way to create a pillar is to draw the
             "pillar sector" with the rectangle, polygon or line tool and
             then delete it.

             When DCK deletes a sector, it removes the side of each line that
             references the sector, making the line one-sided (bright on the
             map.) If a line is already one-sided, it is deleted.

             Scaling the Positions of Objects
             With DCK's scaling tool, you can make an area in your map bigger
             or smaller. Scaling lines or sectors changes the positions of


                                                                           27


             the vertices that make up the lines, based on the center of all
             the marked objects. The same applies to Items _ the positions of
             the scaled items is based on the center of the items you've
             marked.

             Mark the objects you want to scale and press Ctrl+A or select
             "Scale Marked Objects" from the Object Menu.

             Now, use the following keys to expand and contract the positions
             of the objects:

             Press       To do This.
             This...
             < and >     Expand and Contract the objects
             Enter       Finish scaling the objects
             ` (above    Toggle fine mode. If fine mode is on, objects are
             TAB)        scaled by a factor of +0.025. If fine mode is off,
                         objects are scaled by a factor of +0.1 each time
                         you press < or >.
             ESC         Cancel the operation and return the objects to
                         their original placement
             Ctrl+A      Use a Dialog Box to enter an absolute scaling
                         factor

                 Tip: You can use all of DCK's map control functions -
                 grid, snap to grid, zoom and so on - while you're
                 scaling or rotating objects.


             Rotating the Positions of Objects
             Like the scaling tool, the rotation tool rotates the positions
             of the marked objects around their cumulative center. Mark the
             objects you want to rotate and press Ctrl+O, or select "Rotate
             Marked Objects" from the Object Menu.

             Now, use the following keys to rotate the positions of the
             objects:

             Press       To do This.
             This...
             < and >     Rotate the objects counterclockwise and clockwise
             Enter       Finish scaling the objects
             ` (above    Toggle fine mode. If fine mode is on, objects are
             TAB)        rotated by +1.0o. If fine mode is off, objects are
                         rotated by +10.0o each time you press < or >.
             ESC         Cancel the operation and return the objects to
                         their original placement
             Ctrl+O      Use a Dialog Box to enter an absolute rotation
                         angle

             Removing Parts of Your Map
             If you want to remove an area of your map, the best way is to
             delete the walls that make it up. First, switch to Line Edit
             mode by pressing L or selecting "Line Mode" from the Edit Menu.


      28  DCK 3.0 User's Guide


             Next, mark the lines that you want to remove from the map and
             press the Del key or select "Delete" from the Edit Menu.

                 Tip: Use the box-mark feature (see page 9) to quickly
                 mark a rectangular area on the map.

             If you accidentally delete something, choose "Undo" from the
             Edit Menu or press Alt+Backspace to restore what was removed.
             You must do this before making any other changes, however!

             Joining Separate Areas
             DCK's "autojoin" feature makes it easy to connect two areas.
             Simply drag part of one area over top of another, and DCK will
             join the two areas with a two-sided line that the player can
             cross.

             You can also join two unlike lines explicitly using the Join
             Tool. Highlight the first of the two lines you want to join and
             press Ctrl+B. Next, move the cursor to highlight the second of
             the lines you want to join and press Ctrl+B again or click the
             left mouse button once. Everything that was connected to the
             vertices of the first line is moved to connect to the vertices
             of the second line, and the second line is made two-sided so
             that the player can pass through it.

             Splitting a Sector
             To split a sector, you must use the Line-drawing tool; press `L'
             or choose "Line Tool" from the Edit Menu. Using the tool, you
             draw the single line which will split the existing sector into
             two.

             Choose the starting point for the splitter line along the
             outline of the sector you want to split and double-click the
             left mouse button once. Now, move the mouse to a second point on
             the sector and click the right mouse button once. DCK displays a
             menu with two choices; choose "Create Sector Split." DCK splits
             the original sector by creating a new sector on one side of the
             line and keeping the original sector on the other side.


                                                                           29



             Chapter 8

             Other Tools


             Here, the other major tools available in DCK are described.

             Checking your Map for errors
             Over time, little errors may creep into your map. Most of them
             won't cause any big problems, but it's always nice to know that
             they're easily found and fixed - with DCK's error checker, most
             are.

             After activating it, the checker runs through every object in
             the map and checks it against a series of rules that have been
             set up to detect flaws in the map's structure: Deviations from
             the rules set down by the DOOM engine's limitations, situations
             that may have undesired effects, and so on. A list of all the
             errors the map checker catches can be found at the end of this
             section.

             Those objects that DCK finds as problematic are added to a list
             of errors, which is displayed when all the checks are complete.
             From this list, most of the errors can be "zoomed in on" and
             fixed with a couple of keystrokes. However, some errors (such as
             the "Sector not Closed" error) cannot be fixed automatically
             because of their abstract nature.

             To activate the checker, choose it from the Miscellaneous menu
             or press Alt+C. The dialog box that is subsequently displayed is
             a list of options for the checker: it will only perform the
             kinds of checks that are selected here.

             The checker displays the list of errors, from which you can:

             - Get help on the current error by pressing F1. This option
               displays a detailed description of the error, explaining how
               it is fixed or how to fix it manually.
             - Jump to the object in error by pressing 'G'. DCK will switch
               to the appropriate edit tool and zoom in and center on the
               object. This option is not always available; for example, the
               error "Too few player starts" is a general error and cannot
               be zoomed in on.
             - Fix the error by pressing 'F'. If the error is a simple one,
               such as a line missing a texture, DCK will fix it and change
               the error list to reflect the fixed object. If you want to
               get information on what automatically fixing a particular
               error does, press F1.

             The WAD Manager
             Accessible from the File menu or by pressing Alt+W, DCK's WAD
             manager allows you to edit and view .WAD files much like you'd
             do with a DOS directory navigator. With it, you can:


      30  DCK 3.0 User's Guide



             - add entries to a WAD file from data in other WAD files or
               from raw files anywhere on your system;
             - combine two or more maps into one WAD file;
             - rename existing entries in WAD files;
             - delete existing entries from WAD files.

             The WAD manager works with a "Source List" and a "Destination
             List."  The Source list is the list of files in the current
             directory, or the list of entries in a WAD file. The Destination
             list is the directory of the final WAD file - the file you're
             editing with the WAD manager.

             When you start the WAD manager, the source list displays the
             contents of the current directory, and the destination list
             contains the contents of the WAD that you're working on in the
             map editor. You can place any of the entries from the source
             list into the destination list, thereby "building" the desired
             WAD file.


                                                                           31


             Use the following commands while navigating the source list:

             Press This...   To do This.
             Enter           Change to the directory the highlight bar is
                             over.
             Enter           View the contents of the WAD file the
                             highlight bar is over.
             Enter           View the contents of the data file the
                             highlight bar is over.
             Enter           View the contents of the WAD file entry the
                             highlight bar is over.
             Ctrl+P          Place the data file or WAD file entry into
                             the Destination.
             Ctrl+X          Save the WAD file entry the highlight bar is
                             over to a file on the disk.

             Build up the destination list by copying data items (files or
             WAD entries) from the source list into the destination. You can
             load an existing WAD into the destination with the Load button
             (or press Ctrl+L), and save the destination list to a WAD file
             with the Save button (or press Ctrl+S.)

             To view an entry in either of the lists, press ENTER. If the
             entry is a map, it will be displayed. Otherwise, DCK will give
             you the choice of displaying the entry as a "binary dump" or as
             a game picture.

             To add the highlighted source entry into the destination list,
             click the Put button (or press Ctrl+P.) DCK will, by default,
             save the data as its original name - if it's a file, the
             filename without the extension; if it's a WAD entry, the name
             from the .WAD.

             If the entry you're placing in the destination already exists,
             and the "Replace Entries" checkbox is not set, DCK will ask you
             if you'd like to overwrite the existing entry, rename the new
             one, or not save it at all.

             To save an entry from either the destination list or the source
             list to a raw file, press Ctrl+X.

             Using the Clipboard
             The clipboard allows you to copy a part of your map to a
             temporary space, and then "paste" the information into another
             part of your map - or into an entirely different map.

             When you copy parts of the map to the clipboard, the "edit mode"
             you're currently using affects what is copied, and what is
             pasted. For example: When you're editing walls/lines, DCK is in
             "Line Mode." If you use the copy feature from line mode, only
             the lines you mark will be copied - none of the sectors the
             lines reference will be copied. When you then paste the
             information, new lines will be created, but they will reference
             the original sectors since no new sectors have been created.

             The best mode to use for copying complex areas of the map is
             Sector Mode, since DCK will copy information for the sectors you
             mark as well as the lines that make them up. There are times,
             however, when copying from Line Mode is the only route to take.
             For example, consider a pillar of one-sided lines in the middle
             of its surrounding sector. If you were to copy the entire
             sector, not only would the pillar be copied, but also all the
             other lines that make up the sector the pillar is in. Instead,
             use Line Mode to mark the lines that make up the pillar and copy
             that information to the clipboard.

             - To copy the marked objects to the clipboard, press Ctrl+Ins
               or choose "Copy" from the Edit Menu.
             - To cut (copy and then delete) the marked objects, press
               Ctrl+Del or choose "Cut" from the Edit Menu.
             - To paste the contents of the clipboard to the map, press Ins
               or choose "Paste" from the Edit Menu.

                 Note: You can also copy, cut and paste map Items
                 (monsters and so on.) Simply mark the Items you want to
                 copy or cut and use the keys listed above.
